# DisplayString

Library handling `String` representation of various types

See ``DisplayString``

Started with trying to streamline display of float values. 

- Decimal places (taming long floating point fraction lengths)
- Units of measurement (percent, hertz, metres, etc)
- Grouping (1426 -> 1,436)
- Property labels ("X" for `CGPoint`, "width" for `CGSize`, "origin" for `CGRect` etc) 

Now growing to cover more types
